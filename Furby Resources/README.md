<h1>Semantics and Ontology</h1>

Ontology paired with semantics brings a stronger understanding into the ideology of Language. Your bringing the "being or strong associations"
with the meaning.<br>
Example:<br>
"I am walking a dog." which has no meaning at all unless ontology is brought into the picture of the structured
data. With Ontology the AI can associate that the "dog" is your best friend. "I am walking a dog." paired with semantics AI can associate that 
you are out walking your best friend. Because there is a relationship with "dog" and "mans best friend" associated in the data of hierarchy. 
<br>
Another Example:<br>
"The country of Afghanastan, has seen hard times." An AI with just semantics, would find a word pattern or encoding that associates best
with that sentence input. Ontology introduced into an AI would find the most significant associated words that bring meaning into hard times, with 
that country. Similar to a human brain, were ontology would vary from a war veteran to a civilian that lived in that country. Hard times would trigger two
different ontologies of hierarchy that humans assocate with "hard times." Different associations of experiences that create emotions and a hierarchy 
of associated words creating meaning and being into an ontology that would associate itself into a sentence, "The country of Afghanastan, has seen hard times."
