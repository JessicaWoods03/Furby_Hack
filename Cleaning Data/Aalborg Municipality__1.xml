'''Aalborg''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''&#197;lborg'', population 161,906 (2001)) is a city and seaport of [[Denmark]], the seat of a ([[Lutheran]]) [[bishop]], and chief town of the county of [[North Jutland]], on the south bank of the [[Limfjord]], which connects the [[North Sea]] and the [[Kattegat]]. Aalborg is the 4'th largest city in Denmark after [[Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus]] and [[Odense]]

The situation is typical of the north of Jutland.  To the west the Limfjord broadens into an irregular lake, with low, marshy shores and many islands.  Northwest is the [[Store Vildmose]], a swamp where the mirage is seen in summer. Southeast lies the similar [[Lille Vildmose]].  Store Vildmose was drained and farmed in the beginning of the 20th century, and Lille Vildmose is now the largest moor in Denmark.

A railway connects Aalborg with [[Hj&#248;rring]], [[Frederikshavn]] and [[Skagen]] to the north, and with [[Aarhus]] and the lines from [[Germany]] to the south as well as [[Copenhagen]] in the east over [[Funen]].  The harbour is good and safe, though difficult to access.  

Aalborg is a growing industrial and commercial centre, exporting grain and fish.  An old castle and some picturesque houses of the [[17th century]] remain.  The cathedral [[Budolphi]] church dates mostly from the middle of the [[18th century]], while the [[Vor Frue]] church was partially burnt in [[1894]], but the foundation of both is of the [[14th century]] or earlier.  There are also an ancient hospital and a museum of art and antiquities.  On the north side of the Limfjord is [[N&#248;rresundby]], connected with Aalborg by a road bridge, by an iron railway bridge as well as by a motorwaytunnel under the Limfjord.  

Aalborg received town privileges in [[1342]] and the bishopric dates from [[1554]].

Aalborg center of a growing telecomunications industry originating from the [[Aalborg University]].

Note that both spellings forms 'Aalborg' and '&#197;lborg' are used in Danish language.
