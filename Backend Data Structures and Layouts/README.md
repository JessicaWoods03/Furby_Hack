<h1>Backend Data Structures and Layouts</h1>
Before coding its important to understand the layout of how you are going to store your data into collections to train the AI. 
On a big project like this it is imparative that I use ChromaDB. The amount of data is huge, that was my only option. Other sites
and options have limited storage capacity, before they charge you. Data structures are imparative to the back end. How you retrieve
that data is also imparative. This folder encompasses the structures of the backend and ChromaDB.<br>
<h4>Below is ChromaDB's layout:</h4> <br>

My secret ingredient..."The Opinion Algorythm" will never be posted but is a part of backend data structures- <br>
A girl should always keep atleast one secret!<br>
(Well GitHub is also making me keep more secrets LOL! I have been flagged to be excessive in this work, and not all files are loading anymore.) <br>
What the API and Pipelines are structured to look like.
