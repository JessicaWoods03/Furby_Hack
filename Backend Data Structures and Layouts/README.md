<h1>Backend Data Structures and Layouts</h1>
Before coding its important to understand the layout of how you are going to store your data into collections to train the AI. 
On a big project like this it is imparative that I use ChromaDB. The amount of data is huge, that was my only option. Other sites
and options have limited storage capacity, before they charge you. Data structures are imparative to the back end. How you retrieve
that data is also imparative. This folder encompasses the structures of the backend and ChromaDB.
